# Application Tracking System

This was a quick demo I threw together, built in about 8 hours.

The goal was to demonstrate the use of GenAI, which has a few uses in the app:

1. Creating a job posting is done by describing the job in natural language (e.g. a project manager in boston) then the full description is generated by a model
2. Analyzing a candidate's resume and video response
3. (I lost this code on a different laptop) Generate audio
