# Application Tracking System

This was a quick demo I threw together, built in about 8 hours.  It was my first Django project.  The goal was to demonstrate the use of GenAI, which has a few uses in the app.

1. Creating a job posting is done by describing the job in natural language (e.g. a project manager in boston) then the full description is generated by a model
2. Analyzing a candidate's resume and video response
3. (I lost this code on a different laptop) Generate audio

What I would do differently:

For deployments:

1. Don't rely on the dev server for static files
2. Implement dotenv
3. Use a venv :)

For the rest:

1. Use OpenAI Structured Outputs instead of dspy
2. Clean up the webcam recording UX
3. Implement a database seeder (the lost code generates an answer to the question, does speech synthesis and then stitches it into an mp4 with MoviePy)
4. Logging of any kid
5. Defer django-q since the tasks were fast enough to postpone the complexity.

## Running

1. Setup & activate venv then install requirements
2. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=`
3. `python manage.py qcluster`
4. `python manage.py runserver`
